# Message in Passage (251201)
Message in Passage (MiP) is an interactive Processing app that explores how embracing time in digital messages can carry emotional weight, intention, and a sense of time presence. Instead of preserving messages in their original states, MiP deteriorates the messages: letters fade character by character and photos erode pixel by pixel.

## 📮 Key Features
**1. Decay of Letters**  

   For letters, characters of the contents would randomly and gradually fade, eventually making the message invisible. 

**2. Decay of Photos**  

   Photos would erode into worn out black and white photos, depending on whether or not the original pixel's brightness was above the threshhold.

## 🛠️ Setup
After making sure all libraries and assets are included, launch the `message.pde` file.

The `postbox.png` was designed by [Freepik](www.freepik.com). The photo decay method was inspired by a post from [Fun Programming](https://funprogramming.org/90-Change-pixel-hue-saturation-and-brightness.html). ChatGPT was used to debug error messages, especially when implementing the `display ()` method for the Photo class.

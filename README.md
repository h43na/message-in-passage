# Message in Passage (251201)
* A slow-technology messaging system where letters and photos gently decay over time.*

## Overview
**Message in Passage (MiP)** is an interactive Processing app that explores how embracing time in digital messages can carry emotional weight, intention, and a sense of time presence. Instead of preserving messages in their original states, MiP deteriorates the messages: letters fade character by character and photos erode pixel by pixel. The system encourages reflection, slowness, and anticipation, thus reshaping how we relate to digital communication.
